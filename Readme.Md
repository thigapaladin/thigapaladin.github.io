# Paladin Manifesto

`All that I have wrought, I have wrought for you.
You must carry this.`

## What the hell is this
A way for me to brain dump all the dumb shit I have stuck in my head, and so when I see some meme in the pally discord about "well if you stick 2 pts in redoubt it TOTALLY makes shockadin viable!!" that I dont fucking drop 100g on respecs.

## Who do I think I am
I have mained a paladin since this stupid game came out.

## What is a paladin
We are paladins. 
We are healers without hots, group heals, or incoming damage mitigation.
We are tanks without a taunt, or itemization.
We are melee dps without a melee attack, and have to stack every stat in the game to do outdps moonkin, and them alone.

Foror & Tigol of the dev team notoriously _hated_ the paladin archetype due to their experiences in everquest and here we are. If you've ever felt that the class feels like something is missing - it's because it was gutted between alpha & beta due to balance issues, and the melee attacks weren't put back.

## Notable Talents

### Holy

#### Consecration
Rank1 is useful for destealthing bad rogues - good ones can walk through it without taking a tick from it. 
This is on the `low` priority debuff list, and it can remove up to `8` other `low` debuffs, such as `ignite`, `winter's chill`, and `deep wounds`. So don't use it on bosses.

#### Unyielding Faith
I love this talent. You will too once you realize how many fears are in this game.

#### Illumination
One of, if not the, most powerful healing talents in the game. Every time you critically heal, all mana is returned to you.

Paladins can't regen mana using spirit because we chain cast constantly, so we never enter the 5 second rule. This is our mana regen.

#### Divine Favor
Combined with Holy Light at max rank you have a 2minute Lay on Hands that costs no mana. It is magic, so shaman, priests & felhunters will delight to take it from you.

#### Holy Shock
As a heal this is moderately useful, occasionally, since it's instant cast. However - it scales terribly, costs as much as a holy light & heals as much as a flash of light. 
It's also on the GCD so it's a very good way to kill your tank.

bUt SpElL bAtChInG shut the fuck up

As a way to snipe kills from **REDACTED** in AB, it's pretty good.

### Protection

#### Redoubt
Ironically kinda bad for tanking 'cause you don't want to be crit. So useful though for fighting off rogues, warriors & hunter pets.

#### Guardian's Favor
2 Minutes off of BoP & 6 extra seconds on freedom. One of the most important talents we have.

#### Blessing of Kings
10% stats - c'mon. Used to be the 31pt ret talent, so there was a point to bring ret pallies.

#### Reckoning
Turn off auto attack, collect crits, one shot someone.
"bUt PsErVeRs" shutup they were broken there - this works the way it did back in the day.

### Retribution

#### Improved Blessing of Might
The Warriors won't thank you for this. They'll never thank you for anything.

#### Seal of Command
7 Procs Per minute, the only way you'll ever see an attack animation. Use a slow two hander.

#### Pursuit of Justice
It's 2 talent points for 7 sta & not having to equip a carrot on a stick.
???

#### Eye for an Eye
you'll still be dead but you can moderately hurt that elemental shaman back. hooray for 400 damage from the grave.

#### Repentance
ranged gouge on a one minute timer. priests can dispel it, warriors can zerker rage out. dots break it. 8pc judgement breaks it.

it's good for catching hunters? if it doesn't get resisted that is.

## Specs

## Good Specs

### [31/15/5 - "Full Holy"](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/05503102521151-05025102-5)

All the important healing talents. I don't take Imp LoH because it turns your emergency heal into a prepull tank cooldown, which while sometimes useful isn't worth it for me.

You get Imp Wisdom, Imp Might & Kings. The fear resistance is occasionally clutch on nefarian.

I prefer redoubt over imp devo aura because this is a pvp server, but you can take devo if you _really_ like your tanks. Closest thing they'll get to wearing a shield tbh.

you can also drop imp might & pick up 2/3 & 3/3 imp hoj / imp concentration aura for PvP.

Orcs & Priests are harder to stun, and _everyone_ knows to kick your heals so it's better to learn to juke, dodge & get peels than to depend on a 15% chance to resist.

### [21/0/30 - "Hybrid Ret"](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/50503101501--50204051220315)

You get Divine Favor & Illumination so you can heal raids. You lose out on 5% crit & holy shock, but holy shock is bad and it's better to stack +healing & downrank than stacking crit. This is the "I don't want to respec, but I want to DPS in PvP & heal in raids" spec.
You can swap Divine Str & Int if you want.

Gearing this in PvP you want Tier 2, with an Ony Tooth neck, Don Julio's, and TUF+. But it screams the class fantasy of fighting on the frontlines with a 2her & throwing heals to your friends.


### [0/25/26 - "Ret Reckoning"](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/-0532510103005-50204051220311)

nooo you can't wear warrior gear and not heal
hahahaha reckoning go brrrrr

enjoy not farming anything, not raiding anything and having to respec twice a week. But man dropping those 6k+ reckbombs is what i remember serotonin feeling like.

### Prot ???
I dunno whatever Alendi does seems to be super good. I hate tanking :shrug:


# Technically not a 'bad' spec but I am loathe to call it a 'good' spec

### [11/8/32 - "PvE Ret"](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/550001-053-552000512203151)

With this, as a human with a sword or mace, you only need 3% hit to cap in PvE.

Strong in PvP, and the only halfway viable PvE DPS spec.


## Bad Specs

### [24/27/0 - Holy Reckoning](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/05503102521-0532410003315)

You can heal but your damage is going to suck. You're pretty tanky and can occasionally drop a reckbomb for ~3k, which is kinda dissapointing.

Honestly I think this is a holdover from phase 1 & 2 PServers where everyone had 3k health, and scaling was broken.

Super good for farming lashers though.

### [31/0/20 - "2h Shockadin"](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/05503102521151--5020305122)

With a ZHC & ~200 Spell power you have ~2k burst damage on command (JoC + DF + HS). However, since _everyone_ is a fucking orc or a priest, you are going to get resisted on your HoJ constantly and your damage will drop to ~1k

The utility abilities like PoJ & E4E are nice but until TBC prepatch when Holy shock drops to 6 seconds, this is kind of a joke. It pains me to say it because I played it SO MUCH back in the day, but the skill level of the average player is so much higher that you can't easily cheese with this anymore. It's also impossible to gear because Judgement of Command uses melee crit, but good luck stacking Spell Power & Melee Crit at the same time to an effective amount.

On the bright side you can raid heal easily with this and I guess solo farm? I dunno who grinds one mob at a time in 2020.

### [0/18/33 "Control Ret"](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/-0532410003-502033512203151)

Scuffed arms warrior. Purge purge purge resist resist kek
