# Paladin Manifesto

## What the hell is this
A way for me to brain dump all the dumb shit I have stuck in my head, and so when I see some meme in the pally discord about "well if you stick 2 pts in redoubt it TOTALLY makes shockadin viable!!" that I dont fucking drop 100g on respecs.

## Who do I think I am
I have mained a paladin since this stupid game came out.

## What is a paladin
We are paladins. 
We are healers without hots, group heals, or incoming damage mitigation.
We are tanks without a taunt, or itemization.
We are melee dps without a melee attack, and have to stack every stat in the game to do outdps moonkin, and them alone.

Foror & Tigol of the dev team notoriously _hated_ the paladin archetype due to their experiences in everquest and here we are. If you've ever felt that the class feels like something is missing - it's because it was gutted between alpha & beta due to balance issues, and the melee attacks weren't put back.

That being said, we have the best sustained single target heals of any healing class, the best AoE threat generation of the tanks & pretty bad DPS. Also super powerful buffs, cleanse & Lay on Hands can save your raid.

## Notable Talents

### Holy

#### Consecration
Rank1 is useful for destealthing bad rogues - good ones can walk through it without taking a tick from it. 
This is on the `low` priority debuff list, and it can remove up to `8` other `low` debuffs, such as `ignite`, `winter's chill`, and `deep wounds`. So don't use it on bosses.

#### Illumination
One of, if not the, most powerful healing talents in the game. Every time you critically heal, all mana is returned to you.

Paladins can't regen mana using spirit because we chain cast constantly, so we never enter the 5 second rule. This is our mana regen.

#### Divine Favor
Combined with Holy Light at max rank you have a 2minute Lay on Hands that costs no mana. It is magic, so shaman, priests & felhunters will delight to take it from you.

#### Holy Shock
As a heal this is moderately useful, occasionally, since it's instant cast. However - it scales terribly, costs as much as a holy light & heals as much as a flash of light. 
It's also on the GCD so it's a very good way to kill your tank.

bUt SpElL bAtChInG shut the fuck up

As a way to snipe kills from **REDACTED** in AB, it's pretty good.

### Protection

#### Redoubt
Ironically kinda bad for tanking 'cause you don't want to be crit. Useful though for fighting off rogues, warriors & hunter pets.

#### Guardian's Favor
2 Minutes off of BoP & 6 extra seconds on freedom. One of the most important talents we have.

#### Reckoning
Turn off auto attack, collect crits, one shot someone.
ignore the folks who are talking about pserver stuff, this works the same way I remember.

### Retribution

#### Seal of Command
7 Procs Per minute, the only way you'll ever see an attack animation. Use a slow two hander.

#### Pursuit of Justice
It's 2 talent points for 7 sta & not having to equip a carrot on a stick.
???
I can never decide if I like it or not.

#### Vindication
Useful in PvP, -15% Str & Agi is pretty huge. But this does nothing in PvE as mobs only have Health & AP, not base stats. Most mobs are immune, but some like `nefarian` it will apply to and consume a buff slot. So if you PvE dps at all (including tossing up a judgement of wisdom), avoid.

#### Eye for an Eye
you'll still be dead but you can moderately hurt that elemental shaman back.

#### Repentance
ranged gouge on a one minute timer. priests can dispel it, warriors can zerker rage out. dots break it.

## Specs

### [31/15/5 - "Full Holy"](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/05503102521151-05025102-5)

All the important healing talents. I don't take Imp LoH because it turns your emergency heal into a prepull tank cooldown, which while sometimes useful isn't worth it for me.

You get Imp Wisdom, Imp Might & Kings. The fear resistance is occasionally clutch on nefarian.

I prefer redoubt over imp devo aura because this is a pvp server, but you can take devo if you _really_ like your tanks. Closest thing they'll get to wearing a shield tbh.

you can also drop imp might & pick up 2/3 & 3/3 imp hoj / imp concentration aura for PvP.

Orcs & Priests are harder to stun, and _everyone_ knows to kick your heals so it's better to learn to juke, dodge & get peels than to depend on a 15% chance to resist.

### [21/0/30 - "Hybrid Ret"](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/50503101501--50204051220315)

You get Divine Favor & Illumination so you can heal raids. You lose out on 5% crit & holy shock, but not the end of the world. This is the "I don't want to respec, but I want to DPS in PvP & heal in raids" spec.
You can swap Divine Str & Int if you want.

Gearing this in PvP you want Tier 2, with an Ony Tooth neck, Don Julio's, and TUF+. But it screams the class fantasy of fighting on the frontlines with a 2her & throwing heals to your friends.

If you swap divine favor for repentance, you're looking at a very niche premade healer build.


### [0/25/26 - "Ret Reckoning"](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/-0532510103005-50204051220311)

nooo you can't wear warrior gear and not heal
hahahaha reckoning go brrrrr

enjoy not farming anything, not raiding anything and having to respec twice a week. But man dropping those 6k+ reckbombs is what i remember serotonin feeling like.

### Prot ???
I dunno whatever Alendi does seems to be super good.


### [11/8/32 - "PvE Ret"](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/550001-053-552000512203151)

With this, as a human with a sword or mace, you only need 3% hit from gear to cap in PvE.

Strong in PvP, and the only viable PvE DPS spec.


### [24/27/0 - Holy Reckoning](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/05503102521-0532410003315)

You're pretty tanky and can occasionally drop a reckbomb for ~3k.

Super good for farming, strong heals and _tons_ of utility.

### [31/0/20 - "2h Shockadin"](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/05503102521151--5020305122)

With a ZHC & ~200 Spell power you have ~2k burst damage on command (JoC + DF + HS). However, since _everyone_ is a fucking orc or a priest, you are going to get resisted on your HoJ constantly and your damage will drop to ~1k

The utility abilities like PoJ & E4E are nice but until TBC prepatch when Holy shock drops to 6 seconds, this is kind of a joke. It pains me to say it because I played it SO MUCH back in the day, but the skill level of the average player is so much higher that you can't easily cheese with this anymore. It's also impossible to gear because Judgement of Command uses melee crit, but good luck stacking Spell Power & Melee Crit at the same time to an effective amount.

### [0/18/33 "Control Ret"](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/-0532410003-502033512203151)

Scuffed arms warrior. Purge purge purge resist resist kek
With engineering bombs, 4pc r10 & repentance you can be _extremely_ annoying. Very specific use case and most times you're probably better off going ret/reck.

## Gear

I dunno hopefully Alendi updates this

### Ret

For the most part, ret gears like a DPS warrior. With p5 & AQ being out - you get into t2.5 and wear it forever. Like most melee classes, the majority of ret damage comes from white hits.

#### Threat 

Something to point out about how threat works. Most DPS classes have a flat modifier that reduces how much threat they generate. Ie, they hit for `100` they generate `70` threat. With `Blessing of Salvation` that number is further reduced by `30%`, so they hit for `100` they generate `49` threat. Paladins threat reduction is `Blessing of Salvation` exclusively, so if you hit for `100` you generate `70` threat. This isn't fixed until [the end of TBC](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Fanaticism). This is problematic since paladin dps threat is spikey by design, slow two handers, seal of command & `hand of justice` being BiS.

To be a _"good"_ ret paladin you need to watch the threat meter and be prepared to back off by knowing how much your burst can hit for. Having a macro for a shield is huge and knowing how to position the boss if you pull threat is a necessity.

#### GCD breaks Procs
If your [GCD is active](https://www.wowhead.com/news=317112/blizzard-on-proc-effects-and-the-gcd-in-wow-classic) a proc can't occur. This counts for Seal of Command!

#### SpellRet
There is a meme spec among the memespecs called SpellRet, where you stack spellpower like a SP hunter, use a manual crowd pummeler & an extreme amount of consumables. It requires 2 debuff slots, one being consecration. It's not viable.

#### Seal Twisting
When you judge command, if you _immediately_ cast another seal it will batch & apply to the target. JoC->SoR increases your DPS somewhat but will consume your mana very quickly. I only use this in PvP against healers, JoC->Seal of Justice has a good chance to stun which can act like half assed interrupt.

#### Overall

Ret's DPS is bad, but if you world buff & use enough consumes you can fight for middle of the pack dps. I consider getting into the `top 10` the equivalent of hitting `1` for a real dps class. Don't let the existential dread of knowing the raid would be better off with another healer, or that a warlock with all these buffs auto attacking with a firestone would do comparable damage. Don't think about it.
